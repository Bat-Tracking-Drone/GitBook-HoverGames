## HoverGames website

The main website for HoverGames is [HoverGames.com](https://www.HoverGames.com).

## NXP Mobile Robotics Community

The [NXP Mobile Robotics Community](https://community.nxp.com/community/mobilerobotics) has a space dedicated to [HoverGames](https://community.nxp.com/community/mobilerobotics/hovergames-drone-challenge). Here you can ask your questions about the drone kit and add-on boards. There is also a subspace for the [NavQ Companion Computer](https://community.nxp.com/community/mobilerobotics/hovergames-drone-challenge/navq-8mmnavq-discussion). For questions about PX4 Autopilot and other Dronecode software you can use the platforms mentioned below.

## PX4 Slack and Discuss forum

HoverGames has its own Slack channel \([\#hovergames](https://px4.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=hovergames)\) on the [PX4 Slack](https://px4.slack.com/). To gain access to the PX4 Slack, you have to register through [this form](https://slack.px4.io/) first. There are many channels on the PX4 Slack related to different Dronecode projects and different features of the PX4 software. It is recommended to have a look at the list of available channels. 

To join [\#hovergames](https://px4.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=hovergames) you can press "Channels" or the small plus icon next to it, then search for the channel name. If this is not visible, you can make the menu appear by pressing the PX4 logo at the top. Any HoverGames or RDDRONE-FMUK66 specific questions can be asked here. More general PX4 related questions can be discussed in other channels.

Dronecode also has a [Discuss forum](http://discuss.px4.io/) for discussing PX4, QGroundControl, MAVLink, MAVSDK and other Dronecode projects. General questions regarding drones and PX4 can also be asked there.

## Hackster.io Discussion board

General questions can also be asked on the [discussion board for the second HoverGames challenge](https://www.hackster.io/contests/hovergames2/discussion#challengeNav). We try to keep an eye on the new posts and ongoing discussions, but more in-depth or technical questions are better asked on the NXP Mobile Robotics community or on PX4 Slack \(or the PX4 Discuss forum\).

The discussion board for the first challenge is also still available and can be found [here](https://www.hackster.io/contests/hovergames/discussion#challengeNav).
